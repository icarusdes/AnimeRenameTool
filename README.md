# AnimeRenameTool
The name speaks for itself - The aim is an easy one: create a tool that can rename files for a special purpose: 

Usually the japanese style of naming animes are not usable for PLEX, so i have to rename them according to https://thetvdb.com/ database. 
Unfortunatelly the easy solution (using total commanders Multi-Rename tool) didn't work for me. 

It was easier to write a program for that, than spending hours finding the right one.
